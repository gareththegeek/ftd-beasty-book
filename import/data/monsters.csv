They can change colour at will.
Troglodytes secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive.
Troglodytes are very hostile, attacking equal or weaker non-troglodyte groups on sight. They prefer to attack with surprise, depending on their color-changing ability for this.",Advantage to stealth checks,DisAdv. to attack rolls of enemies within 10ft.,,"basic-fantasy, humanoid"
Troll,Brute,6,,d8,30,,STR,STR,"A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. A troll’s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray.
Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.
Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws.",Regenerate 1 hp per round,2 attacks,,"basic-fantasy, giant"
Unicorn,Predator,4,,d6,90,,STR,STR,"Unicorns are horselike creatures having a single spirallytwisted horn in the middle of the forehead.

Alicorn,Predator,4,,d8,90,,STR,STR,"An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth.
Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties.",Invisible at will,,,"basic-fantasy, celestial"
Urgoblin,Soldier,2,,0,30,,STR,STR,"These creatures appear to be normal hobgoblins, but urgoblins are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to regenerate much as do trolls.
Some hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and kill them whenever they can be identified.

Vampire,Leader,8,,d6,30,60,STR,STR,"Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of wolves. They often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they knew in life.
Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 doesn’t always destroy it. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight or running water destroys it in three rounds. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described above, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre.","Immune to sleep, charm and hold magic and non-magical weapons

"Whale, Killer",Predator,6,,d6,0,90,STR,STR,"These ferocious creatures are about 30 feet long. Killer whales, also called ""orca"" (both singular and plural), are strikingly marked in black and white, with prominent white patches that resemble eyes.

Wraith,Brute,4,,d4,0,90,STR,STR,"Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. In some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear armored or outfitted with weapons.

A wyvern’s body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to grey; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings.
Wyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.
Wyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death.",Flying 90ft.,Hit: sting CON save vs. poison or die,Grab prey and carry off - grappled,"basic-fantasy, monstrosity"
