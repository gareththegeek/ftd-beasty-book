A wyvern's body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to grey; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings.\nWyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.\nWyverns attack nearly anything that isn't obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death.","techniques":["Flying 90ft.","Hit: sting CON save vs. poison or die","Grab prey and carry off - grappled"],"tags":["basic-fantasy","monstrosity"]},{"id":"yellow-mold","name":"Yellow Mold","category":"predator","hitDice":2,"hitDiceMod":0,"numberAppearing":"d8","speed":0,"attack":"con","defence":"con","description":"Yellow mold typically covers an area of 10 square feet.
